# <span style="color:black">[Ode to the Niche     (An Ecologist's Nightmare)](https://www.plexuseco.com/The%20Plexus/po_niche.htm)</span>
With hypervolumetric grin  
I grow more Hutchinsonian  
Despite intense investigation  
Of axial proliferation.   

Each bird I see expands in place  
To seventeen-dimension space;  
And should it light on forest floor,  
Then axes sprout a dozen more!  

Euclid would approve with glee  
How territoriality  
Of bunting perched upon a stone  
Is asymptote to hypercone!   

And should competing species brawl  
A tesseract defines the sprawl.  
Yet meaning loses in the end;  
We've lost the zero origin!   

- Bruce G. Marcot (1983)
